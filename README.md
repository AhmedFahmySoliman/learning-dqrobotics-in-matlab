# learning-dqrobotics-in-matlab

This repository contains resources for learning DQ Robotics using MATLAB.
Currently, the files are in MATLAB Live Script format, meaning that the coding is explained alongside with the mathematical equations that they represent.

### Disclaimer
The current files are under development, and released in an "alpha" state. If you find any issues, please let us know.

### Acknowledgments
Murilo Marinho would like to thank Jan Laine Buendia for her carefully reading of the lessons and many suggestions for improvements.

### Lessons
The following lessons are currently available.
1. *MATLAB Basics*: the very basics of MATLAB, including simple mathematical operations.
2. *Quaternion Basics*: Representing and manipulating quaternions using DQ Robotics MATLAB. Unit quaternions are also introduced and used to represent the rotation of rigid bodies.
3. *Dual Quaternion Basics (Part 1)*: Representing and manipulating dual quaternions using DQ Robotics MATLAB. Unit dual quaternions are introduced and used to represent the pose transformation of rigid bodies. 
4. *Dual Quaternion Basics (Part 2)*: Unit dual quaternions are used to represent lines and planes. Distance functions between points, lines, and planes are also introduced.
